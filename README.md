   - Use Cases: Function call stack, undo/redo, parentheses matching

3. **Queue**
   - Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations
   - Use Cases: Task scheduling, breadth-first search, print spooling

### Tree-based Structures
4. **Binary Tree**
   - Operations: Insert, Delete, Traversals
   - Time Complexity: O(log n) for balanced trees
   - Use Cases: File systems, expression trees, decision trees

5. **Heap**
   - Operations: Insert, Extract Max/Min, Heapify
   - Time Complexity: O(log n) for insert/extract, O(n) for heapify
   - Use Cases: Priority queues, heap sort, graph algorithms

### Graph Structures
6. **Graph**
   - Operations: Add Node, Add Edge, DFS, BFS
   - Time Complexity: O(V + E) for traversals
   - Use Cases: Social networks, navigation systems, dependency graphs

### Hash-based Structures
7. **Hash Table**
   - Operations: Insert, Delete, Search, Collision Handling
   - Time Complexity: O(1) average case
   - Use Cases: Databases, caches, symbol tables

8. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
   - Operations: Insert Word, Search Word, Prefix Search
   - Time Complexity: O(m) where m is word length
   - Use Cases: Autocomplete, spell checkers, IP routing

## üéØ How to Use

### Navigation
- Use the navigation bar to jump to different sections
